For a new set of fans, to tell a new story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before England&#39;s World Cup quarter-final against Sweden, Gary Lineker introduced a two-minute film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the sweeping strings of The National&#39;s &#39;England&#39;, it brought together the team&#39;s miserable shootout history and their occasional moments of glory with their success over Colombia four days before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It ended with the music fading out and Gareth Southgate, 1996&#39;s fall guy, 2018&#39;s head coach, bellowing into the stands with joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It struck a chord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Easily one of the best things I&#39;ve ever seen. Goosebumps,&quot; an England fan wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/josefbone/status/1015986201415815170?lang=en\" title=\"\">as he posted the film online.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Twitter agreed. The video in that post has been viewed 2.3 million times and retweeted more than 22,000 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Montages are massive for us,&quot; said Mark Woodward, BBC Football&#39;s creative lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Without wishing to sound too pretentious, all TV is about creating something in the viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Montages are there to create emotion. They get that visceral anticipation going, but they also bring you back to the past, to where you were when these great moments happened, the places you were, the people you were with, how the country felt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating them used to be a simpler, if more stressful job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often up against deadlines, producers would physically cut tape together, their creativity limited by a handful of camera angles and whatever music library their employers had built up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now there are more than 40 cameras tracking the action at each Euro 2020 match, serving up footage in slow motion, super slow-motion and ultra slow-motion. A host of effects and filters can be added in the edit suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the production values have risen, the concepts have become more ambitious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Wales&#39; opening match against Switzerland on BBC One, goalkeeper and part-time artist Owain Fon Williams painted scenes of Euro 2016 that came to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scotland&#39;s arrival at a first international tournament in 23 years was greeted with a fly-through of the country and its football history, from the Glenfinnan viaduct to David Marshall&#39;s shootout save.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/complaints/complain-online\">Report</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one thing is still more important than anything: the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like to do the expected,&quot; explained Woodward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The danger with montages is thinking one size fits all. You might have a new single, something by Cardi B say. It might be great, current and in the charts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But you really have to drill down into what you want to say and what you want the music to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have used classical music, Polish folk bands, Arabian Oud music before, the more eclectic you can be the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can get inspiration from anywhere, it might be a snippet of a track on a documentary, something in the background of a film, anywhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin Evans found it in John Lewis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evans, Woodward&#39;s opposite number at BT Sport, was shopping one day when something caught his ear. He ran to the store&#39;s speaker to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shazam.com/gb\" title=\"\">Shazam</a>&nbsp;the intriguing track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, for a special occasion, both Evans and Woodward like to bring more than a recording to a montage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biffy Clyro reworked a track called This is the One for BBC&#39;s Scotland campaign opener. And BT Sport marked the end of this Champions League with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vud-FDu0nnI\" title=\"\">an epic four-minute film featuring indie pop band London Grammar.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest thing for me is music, that is the biggest element, that is the hook, that is where you get the hairs on the back of the neck,&quot; said Evans.</p>",

It&#39;s exploitation,&quot; Mr Biden said at Friday&#39;s signing event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The order includes 72 actions and recommendations involving ten agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It suggests that problems have arisen because of large tech firms collecting too much personal information, buying up potential competitors and competing unfairly with small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several recommendations it sets out include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Greater scrutiny of mergers in the tech sector</li>\r\n\t<li>New rules to be set out by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on data collection</li>\r\n\t<li>Barring unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biden administration is also targeting a number of other sectors with the order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It encourages other government agencies to take action to improve competition across healthcare, travel and agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once fully implemented, it would allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter, for example, as well as the ban of early exit fees from internet contracts. It also intends to make it easier for consumers to claim refunds from airlines.&quot;For decades, corporate consolidation has been accelerating,&quot; the fact sheet released by the White House says, describing the order as &quot;a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Biden said that the order seeks to limit the use of &quot;non-compete agreements&quot; as a condition of getting a job, which he claimed can make it harder for people to change jobs and therefore limits wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The executive order alone, however, does not mean these recommendations will come into force immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government agencies responsible will need to implement the changes, while some elements could be subject to court challenges.</p>",

      "content":"<p><strong>Amid the misery of a pandemic that has claimed at least four million lives, the scientific search for its origins has itself become toxic.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is now hideously ubiquitous, Sars-Cov-2 is still only an 18-month-old disease. And the search for its start was officially set in motion in 2020 by a World Health Organization investigative team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions over its conclusions have escalated into a heavily politicised feud. Some research scientists, who have tried to unpick the pandemic&#39;s origins, have been accused of conspiracy and cover-up - based on no evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, 21 researchers - all seeking to understand how a virus that originated in bats transferred into humans - aim to &quot;set the record straight&quot; by publishing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/5075888#.YOcVOi1Q3xh\">their summary of the scientific evidence about the pandemic&#39;s beginning.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s not true that we don&#39;t know where it came from - we just don&#39;t know how it got into humans,&quot; says Glasgow University virologist Prof David Robertson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is widely accepted that an ancestor of the virus was originally a disease circulating harmlessly in wild bats. But it is vital to discover how, where and exactly when that first made its way into a person to prevent a similar future outbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no definitive piece of evidence - no Covid-positive bat or a confirmed first human case - to show conclusively how it started. That may never be known, but the scientists who wrote this latest report want to clarify the available evidence and what it means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have published what is called a pre-print, meaning it has not yet been reviewed and edited by other experts. And its key conclusion, says Prof Robertson, is that this virus&#39;s biological properties closely match viruses that have been found in nature - in bats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This outbreak, he adds, looks very much like the emergence of the first Sars back in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that case, the virus was isolated in a widely-traded animal called a palm civet. Over the next few years researchers discovered very closely related viruses in bats, and in 2017,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698\">the ancestor of the Sars virus was found in a population of horseshoe bats in southern China.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outbreak was essentially tracked and traced back to the wild animal it came from - deadly mystery solved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only difference [with Covid] is that we&#39;ve not found the intermediate species this time,&quot; Prof Robertson says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the bat virus link and the strong association to markets selling live animals are both there</p>",

Several species new to Cornwall were spotted in the county, and it was also a record year for numbers of some scarce migrant species such as Crimson Speckled, Slender Burnished Brass and Scar Bank Gem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Yorkshire, the number of annual moth records submitted rose by around a quarter in 2020. There was also a surge in interest in moth hunting in Shetland, with four species new to the islands recorded last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With many people desperate to find things to do in their own backyard during lockdown, moth trapping provided a distraction and interest, Mark Tunmore said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s a whole new world once people start looking at moths and they&#39;re amazed by what&#39;s in their garden,&quot; he explained. &quot;Even in a very simple garden you can have dozens or hundreds of species, potentially, recorded over a long period of time.&quot;</p>",

It is planned for it to have both autonomous and driver-controlled modes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Wells, professor of business and sustainability at the Cardiff Business School&#39;s centre for automotive industry research, told the BBC: &quot;I cannot see how this car can make any significant contribution to resolving the many problems associated with car ownership and use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The contribution of this car to cleaning the air in our polluted urban centres would be so small as to be impossible to measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is immediately evident if you compare the volume of air likely to pass through the filtration system of the car with the volume of air in total.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New room?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The second big idea behind the car&#39;s design is as an alternative space for owners to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Covid has raised the space crisis. Many of us are living in flats and houses and need more space, an office or a study,&quot; said Mr Heatherwick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With one billion cars in the world which are used for roughly only 10% of the time, there is scope for them to become &quot;valuable real-estate&quot;, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was inspired by first-class airline seats, which are used &quot;to sleep, eat, entertain and work&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The car becomes a communal space for the time when it is not driving.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vehicle will be priced at around &pound;40,000 - something Mr Heatherwick described as &quot;not crazy luxury&quot;.</p>",
